# WFES2

Wright-Fisher Exact Solver 2

Wright-Fisher Exact Solver (`WFES`) implements a variety of exact calculations with the Wright-Fisher model. Unlike other approaches, `WFES` does not use simulations or strong simplifying assumptions. `WFES` benefits from high-performance linear algebra techniques, making it possible to compute exact quantities for biologically realistic population sizes. The following document details the usage of the `WFES` code.
